                            <p>Our transcriber handles the two standardized forms of English Braille; Grade 1 and Grade 2. Grade 1 braille is used by most beginners, and is an almost exact letter-to-letter transcription. This websiteâ€™s Grade 1 braille is completely accurate. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Grade 2 braille is used by most experienced braille readers, using abbreviations and contractions to speed up the reading process. It must be said that currently, a completely accurate Grade 2 braille transcription can only be done by a human transcriber, but this transcriber has been our best attempt at an accurate transcription, including all formalized contractions and abbreviations, with sub rules for uninterrupted syllables and pronunciation. 
                            </p>
                            <p>We hope this can be helpful in making texts more accessible in ways other than audio (which can be slower than reading), and please leave a message on the Contact page if you notice an obvious error, and we will try to fix the mistake. Thank you!
